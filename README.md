This is the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course project. The submitted R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:

1. Downloading and unzipping the data if not ready
2. preparing activity names and relevant features
3. merging training data
4. merging test data
5. merging all data and giving clear, descriptive name for the activity of each record as well as the subject that made the activity
6. create another data table showing the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

"tidyData_Mean.txt" is the result.
